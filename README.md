**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

The code I was given was a python file for a treasure maze enviornment and a game experience as well as some code for testing the agent that was unfinished. The code I created myself was for the deep Q-training algorithm so that the agent can navigate the environment.
I also wrote a short design defense of the model. 

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**

Computer scientists solve problems using logic and creativity. The entire field of emerging technology is built of that creativity that is so essential but it hardly discussed. Computer science matters as it allows for betterment of lives through the digital and physical world. 
Innovations in computer science can change the landscape of every field through better analysis and technological research. 


**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

As a computer scientist I like to approach problems from the bottom up. I believe it important to understand individual parts of an operation before envisioning the whole. 

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization is to do no harm. While not a doctor or another critical role, technology plays a massive part in our lives and can have catastrophic concequences if mishandled. 
User data can be just as valuable as a home or transportation and in the wrong hands that user data could be severely damaging to the safety of a user. Taking steps to ensure that the user is put at the forefront of every decision is vital to ensuring that no harm could be done
